# mithril-app

A simple framework to build [Mithril](https://mithril.js.org) applications using TypeScript and Materialize-CSS. You can either use it as a [GitHub template](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template), or, alternatively, you can run the `npx create-mithrilts-app` tool, which also includes the automatic replacement of some variables.

## Installation

The application is a mono-repository, developed in TypeScript. It typically consists of the following packages:

- root
  - GUI: The client part of the application. 
  - Server: Not provided
  - Shared: Shared type and interface definitions

## Installation

```bash
npx create-mithrilts-app
```

## Development

```bash
pnpm i
npm start
```

## TODO

- Save the settings to the server
- When clicking on the map, add a point of interest.
