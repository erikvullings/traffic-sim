# mithril-app

A simple framework to build [Mithril](https://mithril.js.org) applications using TypeScript and Materialize-CSS. You can either use it as a [GitHub template](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template), or, alternatively, you can run the `npx create-mithrilts-app` tool, which also includes the automatic replacement of some variables.

  - Server: Not provided
  - Shared: Shared type and interface definitions
